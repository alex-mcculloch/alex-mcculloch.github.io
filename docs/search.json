    "text": "Americans are divided on a Biden impeachment inquiry\nA recent ABC/Washington Post poll suggests Americans are split on whether Congress should conduct an inquiry. About 44% say Congress should begin proceedings, while 47% say Congress should not. As expected, polarization extends to this issue as well, with 74% of Republicans approving and 83% of Democrats disapproving of these proceedings. The interesting finding here is that independents are almost perfectly split, with 46% in favor and 45% opposed.\nThe number of those not convinced impeachment is warranted is down from a GBAO/Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll for The Wall Street Journalconducted in August, which found that 52% of Americans oppose impeachment proceedings. However, it is slightly up from a YouGov poll in mid-September, which reported that 41% of Americans opposed impeachment.\nOverall, Americans have not seen enough to adopt a pro-impeachment position. This may change as the proceedings develop, however, they were overshadowed by a looming government shutdown. The public will likely need distance from the current battle in Washington before it can articulate a cogent position on the matter.\n\nMore Americans support Hunter Biden’s indictment than a Joe Biden impeachment inquiry\nAmericans are more convinced Hunter Biden is guilty of committing a crime than they are of any criminal wrongdoing by Joe Biden himself. An Economist/YouGov poll found that 60% of Americans approve of the Hunter Biden indictment, which marks a 16-point difference in support for his father’s impeachment. A noticeable portion of Democrats (42%) and a majority of independents (55%) also express support for Hunter Biden’s indictment.\nCasting Biden as a criminal profiting from the Oval Office might pose a challenge for Republicans. Americans already believe that four presidents—Biden, Trump, Obama, and W. Bush—have financially benefitted from holding office. However, the public strongly associates Biden with age-related issues and Trump with crime.\nHunter Biden’s legal issues do indeed have the potential to pose challenges for the Biden campaign. According to an Emerson College poll, 46% of respondents indicate that Hunter’s gun charges make them less likely to vote for Joe Biden in the 2024 election. However, a nearly equal 47% of respondents say that Donald Trump’s indictments make them less likely to vote for him in 2024. As it stands, neither Biden nor Trump appears to gain a clear advantage from the legal issues of the other."

    "text": "Public reactions to past impeachments have been mixed\nIt’s hard to say how these impeachment proceedings will affect Biden’s approval. Based on the current polling, Republicans have a lot of work to convince voters that this inquiry is warranted. Impeachment is an extreme option to take. A rarity reflected in the number of presidents who have faced impeachment.\nA mere four presidents have found themselves entangled in impeachment proceedings—Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump—but none have been removed from office. Each impeachment inquiry and the subsequent votes to impeach these presidents were carried out against the backdrop of distinct and compelling circumstances.\n\nAndrew Johnson: The 17th president was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1868 primarily because of his violation of the Tenure of Office Act. This act was designed to limit the President’s power to remove certain officeholders, including Cabinet members, without Senate approval. Johnson dismissed Edwin M. Stanton, his Secretary of War, and attempted to replace him with Lorenzo Thomas, a move that directly defied the Tenure of Office Act. This action by Johnson was seen as a violation of the law, leading to his impeachment by the House.\nRichard Nixon: Nixon confronted the largest presidential scandal of the century. It was Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate scandal that prompted impeachment inquiries. Specifically, Nixon’s attempt to hinder the investigation—obstruction of justice—led to an impeachment inquiry. Nixon eventually resigned before the House had an opportunity to vote.\nBill Clinton: Clinton faced an inquiry on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The impeachment stemmed from his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and his attempts to cover up the affair during a deposition in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee. Clinton was accused of giving false testimony under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky and attempting to obstruct the investigation into the affair. The House of Representatives voted to impeach him on these charges on December 19, 1998. However, Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and remained in office for the remainder of his second term as President.\nDonald Trump: The first impeachment of Donald Trump was in December 2019. He was charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The charges were related to a phone call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a political rival, and his son Hunter Biden. It was alleged that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, voted to impeach him on December 18, 2019. However, the Senate, controlled by Republicans, acquitted him in February 2020.\n\nThe gravity of these accusations is reflected in the public response to impeachment proceedings. Nixon experienced a significant decline in public approval long before the first inquiry. He was publicly implicated in the Watergate break-in, which only contributed to the Nixon White House’s growing reputation as a corrupt administration, beginning with a bribery scandal from his former Vice President, Spiro Agnew. Nixon resigned about three months after his first inquiry hearing, leaving office with a 26% approval rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton enjoyed a much different public reaction to his first inquiry. Overall, voters overwhelmingly disapproved of the Clinton impeachment. Slightly under 30% of respondents approved of such action, while 70.6% disapproved. Clinton even received a bump in his approval rating (66% to 73%) one month after the first impeachment hearing.\nTrump faced harsher criticism as his impeachment hearings moved forward. Before the House’s first hearing, the majority of Americans believed an impeachment inquiry was unnecessary. This sentiment is reflected in the initial boost in Trump’s approval rating immediately after the first hearing, which increased from 43% to 49%, peaking a little over two months post-hearing.\nHowever, as the Judiciary Committee continued its work, it successfully eroded the public’s doubts. After the House officially voted to impeach Donald Trump, more Americans approved (45%) of the decision than disapproved (39.9%). This division also extended along gender lines, with a higher percentage of women (57.1%) than men (52.4%) supporting Trump’s impeachment. This disparity may be attributed, in part, to partisan dynamics, as women were more likely than men to identify as Democrats, a group that overwhelmingly supported the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, there’s a clear partisan divide in the approval of impeachment inquiries. In cases where Republicans faced impeachment, the majority of those who approved were Democrats. Conversely, when it was Democratic President Clinton facing impeachment, Republicans comprised the majority of those in favor. Clinton and Trump faced a setback among independents, who accounted for 30.8% and 30% of those who supported their respective impeachments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese cases prove that such an inquiry can benefit either party. In such a highly polarized and well-sorted era, it’s not likely a Nixon scenario will occur. Yet, the impeachment of the most recent president demonstrates that the public can indeed rally behind such action when deemed necessary."

    "text": "Republicans have a lot of work to convince America of the value of an inquiry\nRepublicans have yet to provide strong evidence to justify a possible impeachment of Joe Biden. This may very well change. Democrats were able to present enough evidence for Americans to justify supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump. However, if Republicans have obtained strong evidence, it is strange to not present it in the first hearing.\nThe majority of the country does not support such an inquiry and 50% of voters do not trust that the House will conduct a fair investigation into President Biden. This includes 30% of Republicans and a plurality of independents (48%). Furthermore, 59% of Americans don’t believe any of Biden’s actions warrant impeachment, including three in ten Republicans. This is a severe gap for Republicans to overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonmouth University, Sept 19-24, 2023\n\n\nTo make matters worse, impeachment has temporarily taken a backseat to a potential government shutdown, which was narrowly avoided. Congress managed to avert a shutdown by passing a stopgap measure that extends the deadline to November 17. Shutdowns have historically harmed Republicans in the short term and a recent Morning Consult poll illustrates this trend as one in three voters would have blamed Republicans if it had occurred.\nThe timing of the impeachment hearing may not be ideal for Republicans to effectively sway public opinion in their favor, especially as the public’s attention is currently focused on budget negotiations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 1950, the American Political Science Association (APSA) published a 99-page report urging the two major parties in America to become more centrally organized and nationally focused. The genesis of this report stemmed from the APSA’s concern that the parties did little to distinguish themselves and lacked an authoritative leadership structure that could provide clear and concise platforms.\nNot all political scientists agreed with the report’s recommendations, but it represents a state of politics that is so foreign to us today. Seventy years ago the concern was the lack of polarization, today we exclaim there is too much. So much so that polarization has been credited with a substantial amount of blame for a decline in democratic performance, that is because, in a polarized nation, a party-controlling government has a greater incentive to take institutions designed to protect democratic norms and transform them into authoritarian instruments.\nAssessing the current state of polarization in America and its impact on voters is a complex undertaking due to the multitude of methods available for measuring polarization, each with its unique strengths and limitations. Moreover, polarization can be examined at two primary levels: among political elites, which pertains to politicians, and among the general electorate.\nThese two levels of analysis often yield different results. That is why in the following sections, I will explore polarization at both the elite and voter levels and examine possible reasons for variations between the two."

    "text": "Polarization in Congress\nTo gauge the extent of polarization in the United States, I rely on a valuable tool employed by political scientists – the DW-NOMINATE dataset. Developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal this dataset provides a means to quantify and track the ideological positions of members of Congress. These scores are calculated using votes cast by each member of Congress. Once these scores are obtained, we can calculate the rate of elite polarization by calculating the difference between the average scores of Republicans and Democrats.\nThe following two graphs illustrate the average nominate scores of Republicans, Northern Democrats, Democrats, and Southern Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate. These scores reflect the liberal-conservative spectrum, ranging from -1 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate and House Republicans have exhibited a more rapid rightward shift compared to the gradual leftward movement of Democrats. We can see this increased rate of change begin in the late 1960s and continue through 2023.\nThis change in Republican ideology can be attributed to the civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s. However, we should be careful not to attribute the source of our growing polarization to the large shift within the Republican party. The causes and effects of polarization are complicated and our research on the subject is ongoing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphs above show a clear trend of growing polarization at the elite level. However, politicians are not the most accurate portrayal of the average American. Yes, members of Congress are voted in by their constituents, however, that does not mean they adopt the same preferences as the average voter."

    "section": "Polarization Among the Public",
    "text": "Polarization Among the Public\n\nShared Preferences\nThere is strong evidence to suggest the United States is not as polarized as most claim. Rather, the extreme polarization that is documented can be attributed to a specific group of individuals that represent ideologues and party activists.\nTo gauge the level of polarization among voters, I replicate findings from Levendusky and Pope’s 2011 paper Red States vs. Blue States: Going Beyond the Mean. It is typical for researchers to conduct a simple difference-in-differences (DiD) test to determine polarization. Indeed, the visuals from the previous section are the result of a DiD test.\nI can do the same test to determine the rate of polarization at the voter level, however, Levendusky and Pope offer an alternative. Rather than a simple difference in means, I pool all blue-state and red-state voters into two groups and plot the distribution of their policy preferences. By using density plots we can visualize the distribution of voters’ policy preferences along the liberal-conservative spectrum. The peaks and valleys of the curve indicate where data points are more or less concentrated. This way, we can not only view the unique preferences between the two groups, but also gauge the overlap, or shared preferences, between red- and blue-state voters.\nI create two issue dimensions: economic and social. These dimensions are defined by a collection of survey questions that measure respondents’ attitudes on issues such as spending, social security, abortion, immigration, and affirmative action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is striking about the graphs above is the remarkable level of overlap between red and blue states, with a 91% and 89% overlap in economic and social policy preferences, respectively. This suggests that the general public may not be as polarized as commonly assumed. In fact, these visuals indicate quite the opposite – the American public largely agrees on numerous issues spanning economic and social dimensions.\nFor a formal analysis, I calculate the probability that a random blue-state voter is more liberal than a random red-state voter. The results reveal that a blue-state resident is 55% more likely to hold liberal views on the economic dimension and 56% more likely to do so on the social dimension. While blue-state voters tend to lean more liberal than their red-state counterparts, the difference is roughly akin to a coin toss.\nThe evidence here suggests that red- and blue-state voters share similar preferences. Indeed, even blue states have conservatives and Republicans just as red states have liberals and Democrats. However, it’s essential to consider whether these visuals might obscure crucial information. The notion that the U.S. is not as polarized as commonly assumed raises the question of whether conventional wisdom is misrepresenting reality or if our tests fail to capture the full extent of this phenomenon.\nPartisans tend to be more active and vocal than the average citizen. Therefore, the polarization we often identify might stem from the divisive rhetoric and actions taken by Democrats and Republicans themselves. This partisan divide may be better understood as a division within a specific subgroup rather than a divide between all voters.\nThe graphs below illustrate a more substantial divide between blue-state Democrats and red-state Republicans. While distinct from the previous visuals, these graphs clearly show a large overlap between Democrats and Republicans. The overlap between partisans on the economic dimension is 35% while the overlap for social policy stands at 48%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining these graphs, one can still claim there is still polarization among the American electorate. That is not unreasonable, as polarization is inherent in politics. However, the polarization we observe can largely be characterized as partisan polarization – polarization driven by partisans, rather than average voters.\nThe high level of elite polarization begins to make sense as we observe higher levels of partisan polarization within the electorate. Partisans are more active, they participate in primaries and often hold opinions that are more extreme than their less active peers. Therefore, while we observe less polarization within the entire electorate compared to Congress, the Senators and Representatives who represent these voters most accurately reflect the values of the active voter rather than the passive one.\n\n\nVoter Impact\nSome argue that the perception of increased polarization is, in fact, a result of better partisan sorting. Partisan sorting involves the alignment of political party affiliation with ideological beliefs. This process leads to greater ideological homogeneity within political parties, such as Democrats becoming predominantly liberal and Republicans predominantly conservative.\nThis is distinct from the idea that the public and elected officials are adopting increasingly ideologically extreme and distinct policy positions. Evidence supports the existence of both a better-sorted electorate and a more polarized one. Regardless of one’s preferred interpretation, researchers are still able to identify specific consequences affecting the public.\n\n\nConflict Extension\nPolarization’s growth has introduced voters to new challenges. One notable phenomenon is conflict extension. Unlike the past, when parties primarily disagreed on a few major policy areas like slavery, civil rights, and the New Deal, contemporary polarization spans almost every policy domain. For instance, someone who takes a liberal stance on LGBTQ issues is now more likely to also hold liberal positions on topics such as abortion, gun control, taxation, and environmental regulation. The range of issues over which the two major parties clash has significantly expanded.\nThe question here becomes, who is leading this process? Evidence suggests that party activists are the engine behind this movement. This is for reasons I previously stated. Activists are more likely to harbor ideologically extreme positions and introduce new salient issues to the party.\nFurthermore, changes to the party system have made the party more accessible to activists. Barriers have dropped since the 1960s, which makes this one contribution to the increasingly polarized climate.\n\n\nAffective Politics\nPartisan affiliations not only shape our political beliefs but also impact our emotional reactions toward our political adversaries. As people become better sorted, they tend to exhibit more bias, and experience heightened emotional fluctuations. Those with strong partisan identities not only display hostility toward those outside their group but are also driven toward political activism. This phenomenon operates independently of one’s actual policy positions. Political parties start resembling one’s favorite sports team, motivating voters to become more engaged, not necessarily to promote specific policies, but rather for their team to win or the opposition to lose.\nFurthermore, as one social group clashes with another, our group’s identity takes on a central role in defining their individual identity. Consequently, as partisan competition intensifies, citizens tend to approach politics more as Democrats and Republicans rather than as American voters.\nThis confrontational approach to politics can give the impression that we are more polarized on issues than we truly are. This is because we can visibly perceive and feel a growing social polarization, which is expanding at a faster rate than polarization based on policy positions.\n\nThe current state of American polarization is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. The nation’s political landscape is undeniably more polarized than it was at the publication of the APSA’s report. The historical context reveals a stark transformation from a concern about the lack of polarization to the contemporary alarm of its excess.\nThe concern today refers to social polarization more than issue-based polarization. As our identities become consumed by our political ones, we become more concerned with our side winning. As ideology and partisanship converge, voters are driven to activism, the group primarily responsible for the growing polarization observed in Congress and the overall issue-based polarization across the country."

One particularly stark divide emerged in 2012 when Republicans at the state level enacted legislation aimed at curbing the bargaining power of unions. During this year, Republicans registered a score below 50 for the first time since 1988. However, by the subsequent presidential election, the average Republican had shifted to a more positive stance toward labor unions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a deeply polarized political landscape, it’s not unexpected to observe patterns of partisan division on various issues. As polarization has intensified, partisans have increasingly adopted opposing positions on a wide range of topics, a phenomenon known as conflict extension.

These states are distributed across various regions, including the South, Midwest, Southwest, and Northeast. However, it’s worth noting that many of these states initially reported extremely positive feelings about unions, potentially indicating a ceiling effect.

Simultaneously, the majority of Congresses after the 94th (serving 1975-1977) proposed a total of 4,600 pages of statutes or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the bills introduced, fewer are being passed. Historically, the House has struggled more than the Senate in passing legislation. The percentage of proposed bills being passed by the House has remained under 20% since 1954. The most striking change during this period was the Senate’s ability to pass these larger bills. The Senate passed 56% of bills in 1956 which dropped to under one percent in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why legislation has grown in size. First, it has simply become more difficult to pass bills. The current polarized climate forces lawmakers to spend more time negotiating on more issues. This process results in larger bills as teams of legislators compromise and add specific policies that both sides approve of into one giant bill. As Professor of Political Science, Sarah Binder points out, “When you come up against a deadline, everything is multiple trains are leaving the station, and you put them all on the same track. And that’s how you make deals.”\nSecond, passing legislation is complicated, as laws are often interconnected. For example, Republicans had a difficult time repealing the Affordable Care Act back in 2017 as there was a question as to how to replace it, what goals it would achieve, and what problems in Obamacare it would fix. Moreover, healthcare is a complicated industry and there are many more like it."

    "text": "Polarization in Congress has Steadily Increased Since the 1950s\nTo gauge the extent of polarization in the United States, a tool often utilized is the DW-NOMINATE dataset. Developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, this dataset provides a means to quantify and track the ideological positions of members of Congress. These scores are calculated using votes cast by each Congressional member. The score of a member of Congress falls on a liberal-conservative spectrum measured between -1 and +1. Elite polarization is then calculated by obtaining the absolute difference between average Republican and Democratic scores.\n\nThere is a clear growing divide among members of Congress. Neither the House nor the Senate are immune from rising levels of polarization. The divide in both chambers has not been this extreme since Reconstruction. Much of this divide can be attributed to the ideological evolution of the Republican party.\nSenate and House Republicans have exhibited a more rapid rightward shift compared to the gradual leftward movement of Democrats. We can see this increased rate of change begin in the late 1960s and continue through 2023. Between 1967 and 2023, the GOP’s nominate score increased by 100% while the Democrat’s score increased by approximately 27%. This has resulted in a party system where Republicans are more conservative than Democrats are liberal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increasing polarization within Congress and the broader public, coupled with delayed legislative action, has contributed to a growing sense of mistrust in Congress and the government. Over time, this erosion of trust in government institutions has become evident in survey data. For instance, in 1970, the average percentage of Americans who indicated that they trusted the government to consistently do what is right was slightly over 50%. However, by 2022, this figure had plummeted to a mere 20%. Congress has struggled to regain the trust of the American people, as it hasn’t enjoyed the confidence of more than 25% of Americans since 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Related: Americans are Not as Polarized as We Think |"

    "section": "Congress is Getting Older",
    "text": "Congress is Getting Older\nSenators are often older than the average Representative. This is not surprising as the House is elected every two years, providing more opportunities for voters to remove members of Congress earlier than Senators.\nThe current Congress has an average age of about 59. Separating this by party and chamber we can see this average drops slightly for House members and increases for Senate members. The oldest member of Congress is Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley who is 90 years old and the youngest is Florida Representative Maxwell Frost who is 26 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Baby Boom generation primarily drives this increase in age. In 2023, 48.3% of members of Congress are boomers. Accounting for the 5.4% of members who are of the Silent generation, over half of Congress are over the age of 59.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost interestingly, Boomers in Congress are doing better holding onto a plurality than previous generations. This is their 25th Congress and they make up nearly half of the institution. At this point in their careers, the Silent Generation made up about one-third, the Greatest Generation performed similarly at 45.4%, and the Lost Generation managed to be one-quarter of Congress. Although Boomers are close to matching the Greatest Generation at this point in their careers, the Greatest Generation’s birth years lasted 27 years while Boomers’ birth years lasted 19 years. Given the eight-year difference, we’d expect members of the Greatest Generation to last longer in Congress.\nSuch an older Congress has consequences on legislation. Legislators tend to concern themselves with issues that most impact constituents that are most similar to them. Indeed, Curry and Hayden (2018) found that senior lawmakers are more likely to sponsor legislation focused on particular senior issues when those issues are less publicly salient.\nFurthermore, a focus on senior issues likely comes at the cost of attention paid to the issues affecting young Americans. There is already a generational divide on key issues. For instance, young Americans are more concerned with the impact of climate change than their older counterparts are. Housing and healthcare are topics of concern for all Americans, however, younger and older generations approach the topics from different areas of need. Young voters are more concerned with affordable housing and the opportunity to build wealth, while older Americans are more focused on access to assisted living and retirement funds."

    "text": "Campaign Expenditures are on the Rise\nCampaign funds for House incumbents have shown a consistent upward trend since 1974. Interestingly, the amount of money raised by these incumbents is closely tied to the outcome of their elections. Incumbents who secure their re-election with more than 60% of the vote tend to raise less money. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that these incumbents often represent safe districts and, therefore, don’t need as much funding to compete effectively. On the contrary, incumbents who face defeat in their re-election bids tend to spend the most money on their campaign efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of this rise in campaign contributions can be traced to the number of political action committees (PAC). The total number of super PACs that contribute to campaigns sharply increased between 1976 and 1986 after plateauing for about ten years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, since 2000, the majority of contributions are from independent expenditures. The Federal Election Commission defines this term as “an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate and which is not made in coordination with any candidate or their campaign or political party.” This can include super PACs, individual organizations, such as unions, and businesses/corporations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how voters distribute their donations, which businesses contribute the most to campaigns, and to whom they contribute visit Open Secrets."
